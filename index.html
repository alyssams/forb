					<div class="thought left me animation-element slide-left">
						<p>I love exploring all things digital and tying it in with a story. Learning how the things we build and how people work &amp; play with them is a constant thought I have in the projects we create. Our world has changed so much due to how we interact with websites, apps,etc. The core of it is all the same; it is how we, the creators of these things make it easy, fun, and perhaps life enhancing for those who want to use it.</p>
						<p>I love helping others and providing leadership. If you need an email built, let me help build you a system that can not only churn out those emails faster but make sure they are compliant to best practices. Let's make them data driven and user friendly.</p>
						<p>I want our team to explore more in making not only our shows stand out but how our brand can stand out with them.</p>

					<div class="thought right work animation-element slide-left">
						<p>I began working here a little over a year ago and I've helped create an application for saling our advertising products, an email framework to push out emails faster, and help push UX and QA into our digital projects.</p>
						<p>I have learned a lot from Julio and his words and guidance has helped me grow immensely. He’s helped me become a better communicator, listener, and one day leader. I was outside my element here because there was no real digital team but who cares, I get to help shape what that looks like.</p>
						<p>We are a work in process.</p>
						<p>We are a team that is considered to be an agency but we don’t operate like one.  Our team is filled with immensely hard-working individuals that don't give up. We push out a lot of work and individual campaigns are good, but we lack direction and direction is something I have shown I  can provide.</p>
						<p>I believe in us and I know we can be better.</p>

					<div class="thought left hulu animation-element slide-left">
						<p>Our brand can be stronger. We need to do this in advertising. It's at our fingertips.</p>
						<p>I want to build a lab.</p>
						<p>A Hulu Lab where we can experiment and play with the data we receive about our audience for the brand and the shows. We don't push the limits of digital in our team and it's a missed opportunity.</p>
						<p>Let's fix that. Marketing is such a big chuck of our company and our team holds the keys to executing outstanding, FWA worthy content.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="thought right future animation-element slide-left">
						<p>I want to help lead this team into rethinking how we build digital products. Ideally, I want to be a manager for all digital products in our team. I've got the vision, passion, and pack full of knowledge and experience to do it.</p>
						<p>I'm looking forward to the work you help create with our team. You've done a lot of super cool shit and it would be a pity for that not to be seen here (on this team). Learning from you will be the biggest treat.</p>
						<p>Let's launch something great.</p>
