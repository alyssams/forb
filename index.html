						<p>I began working here a little over a year ago and I naively thought that I would be able to quickly change the way this team sees and works in digital.</p>
						<p>I was wrong.</p>
						<p>And I wasn’t ready.</p>
						<p>At first I fought trusting Julio because I had never had a boss that did not what I knew (skillwise) intimately. He doesn’t code. He doesn’t know UX. He doesn’t know digital like I know digital.</p>
						<p>But what he does know I’ve listened to.</p>
						<p>He’s helped me become a better communicator, listener, and one day leader. I was outside my element here because there was no real digital team but who cares, I get to help shape what that looks like.</p>

						<p>We are a team that is considered to be an agency but we don’t operate like one. I hope you help change this. Our team is filled with immensely hard-working individuals that don't give up. We churn out a lot work and indiviual campaigns are good, but we lack direction. Thankfully this is changing. </p>
						<p>This is why I've stayed. I believe in us.</p>
